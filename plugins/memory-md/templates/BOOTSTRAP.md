# First Run Setup - Memory-md

Welcome! This is your first time using memory-md. I will ask you detailed questions to set up your memory system.

## Setup Process

I will ask you questions one by one. Please answer each question before I proceed to the next.

After gathering all information, I will create:
- MEMORY.md - Your long-term preferences and important facts
- IDENTITY.md - How you want me to behave
- USER.md - Your profile information

Then I will delete this BOOTSTRAP.md file.

## Questions

### 1. Your Basic Info (for USER.md)

- What is your full name?
- What is your role/job title?
- What timezone are you in?
- What are your preferred working hours?
- What language do you prefer for communication?

### 2. Your Tech Preferences (for MEMORY.md)

- What are your primary programming languages?
- What frameworks/libraries do you use most?
- Any specific coding standards or style guides you follow?
- Preferred database systems?
- Preferred cloud platforms or hosting?
- Any tools you absolutely want me to use or avoid?

### 3. Project Context (for MEMORY.md)

- What type of projects do you usually work on?
- Any architectural patterns you prefer (e.g., Clean Architecture, MVC, Microservices)?
- Testing preferences (TDD, unit vs integration, testing frameworks)?
- Documentation standards you follow?
- Any recurring project decisions I should remember?

### 4. My Identity (for IDENTITY.md)

- What name should I use for myself?
- How formal/casual should I be?
- Any personality traits you prefer (e.g., concise, detailed, proactive, careful)?
- Should I ask for confirmation before major changes?
- How do you want me to handle uncertainties or ambiguities?

### 5. Daily Memory Preferences

- Should I automatically update daily logs with our activities?
- What level of detail do you want in daily logs (brief summary vs detailed steps)?
- Any specific things you always want me to track?

## After Setup

I will:
1. Ask these questions one by one
2. Create the three memory files based on your answers
3. Delete this BOOTSTRAP.md
4. Start proactively updating your daily memory
