# First Run Setup - Memory-md

Welcome! This is your first time using memory-md. I will ask you detailed questions to set up your memory system optimally.

## Memory File Purposes (NO OVERLAP)

| File            | Purpose               | Examples                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **USER.md**     | About YOU (the human) | Your name, role, how YOU like to work        |
| **IDENTITY.md** | About ME (the AI)     | My name, how I should behave, my persona     |
| **MEMORY.md**   | Technical knowledge   | Tech stacks, coding rules, project decisions |

## Golden Rule

**NEVER put the same information in multiple files.** Each fact goes to exactly one file.

## Questions

### 1. USER.md - About You (The Human)

**Personal Info:**

- Your full name?
- Your role/job title?
- Your timezone?
- Preferred working hours?
- Preferred language for communication?

**How You Like to Work:**

- Do you prefer detailed explanations or concise answers?
- Do you like me to ask before making changes or just do it?
- Any communication styles you dislike?

### 2. IDENTITY.md - About Me (The AI)

**My Identity:**

- What name should I use for myself?
- How formal/casual should I be?
- My personality (e.g., proactive, careful, direct, friendly)?

**My Behavior Rules:**

- Should I ask for confirmation before major changes?
- How should I handle uncertainties (ask you vs make educated guesses)?
- Any phrases or approaches I should always use or avoid?

### 3. MEMORY.md - Technical & Project Knowledge

**Tech Stack:**

- Primary programming languages?
- Frameworks/libraries you use most?
- Preferred database systems?
- Cloud platforms or hosting preferences?

**Coding Standards:**

- Specific style guides you follow?
- Testing approach (TDD, unit vs integration)?
- Documentation standards?
- Architecture patterns you prefer?

**Important Decisions:**

- Any conventions you want me to always follow?
- Tools you absolutely want me to use or avoid?
- Recurring project patterns I should remember?

## What Goes Where (Examples)

### ✅ CORRECT

- "My name is Zhafron" → **USER.md**
- "Call yourself Jarvis" → **IDENTITY.md**
- "Always use PostgreSQL" → **MEMORY.md**
- "I prefer concise answers" → **USER.md**
- "Be proactive and suggest improvements" → **IDENTITY.md**
- "Use TypeScript for all new projects" → **MEMORY.md**

### ❌ INCORRECT (Redundant)

- Same info in USER.md and MEMORY.md
- My behavior rules in USER.md (belongs in IDENTITY.md)
- Your preferences in IDENTITY.md (belongs in USER.md)

## After Setup

I will:

1. Ask these questions **ONE BY ONE** (not all at once)
2. Create three separate memory files with **NO OVERLAP**
3. Delete this BOOTSTRAP.md
4. Start proactively updating daily logs

Let us begin. Answer the first question from section 1:
